* the date and time of the user's last login
* the roles and the number of users with that role

The Administrator has the rights to:

* xref:import-export-an-organization.adoc[import an organization exported from Bonita Studio]

*Developer environment:* When you are testing a process locally by running it from Bonita Studio, the default organization defined in the Studio is *automatically published* to the Bonita Portal.

You must xref:first-steps-after-setup.adoc[create a user with the Administrator profile]. This user can than create and manage the organization.
