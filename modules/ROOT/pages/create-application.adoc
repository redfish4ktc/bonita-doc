:description: Creating the application is the final step of this Getting Started tutorial.

Creating the application is the final step of this Getting Started tutorial.

But before we actually create the application, we need to deploy our application page in the Bonita Portal:

. In the Bonita Studio project explorer, go to *Pages/Forms/Layouts*
. Select _claimsList_ page
. Right click and select *Deploy*

Now we are ready to actually create the application. In the Bonita Community Edition, the easiest way to create an application is to use the Bonita Portal:

. Click on the Portal icon image:images/getting-started-tutorial/create-application/portal-icon.png[Portal icon] in the Bonita Studio tool bar
. In the upper right corner of the window, click on the *User* drop down menu
. Select *Administrator*
. Click on the *Applications* tab
. Click on the *New* button
. Configure the application:
 ** Display name: _Claims_
 ** URL: _claims_
 ** Version: _1.0_
 ** Profile: _User_
 ** Description: _Claims management application_
. Click on the *Create* button
+

You now need to edit the application to add the previously created application page:

. Click on the *...* icon in the *Actions* column
. In the *Pages* section, click on the *Add* button
. In the drop down list, select _custompage_claimsList - claimsList_
. In *URL* type: _claims-list_
. Click on the *Add* button
. In the pages list, click on the *home icon* to set claims-list as the home page and delete the default home
. We've kept this application very simple, with only a single page, so we don't need to define a navigation menu

You can now click on the application URL, and you'll see the application page displayed in the default application layout.
