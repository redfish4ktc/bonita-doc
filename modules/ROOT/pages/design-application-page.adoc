= Design an application page
:description: So far, with a process, data, forms, and connectors, we've built a fully functional software solution to manage claims. But what if we want to have a dashboard showing all ongoing claims? Such a dashboard is not a process. Yyou should not have to "start" it in order to view it. A Bonita application is the answer.

So far, with a process, data, forms, and connectors, we've built a fully functional software solution to manage claims. But what if we want to have a dashboard showing all ongoing claims? Such a dashboard is not a process. Yyou should not have to "start" it in order to view it. A Bonita application is the answer. And the first step to build an application is to create pages.

[NOTE]
====

Pages in Bonita are a lot like forms. They are created with the UI Designer with the same sets of widgets. The main difference is that they are not bound with a process definition (like instantiation forms and user tasks forms). An application page can display business data values, charts and even let the user start a process or execute a task by displaying the appropriate form.
====

For this example, we will build a basic page that displays all the claims submitted in a table. To create a new page:

. Click on the *UI Designer* icon image:images/getting-started-tutorial/design-application-page/ui-designer.png[UI Designer icon] in the Studio tool bar
. Ignore the information message pop up window
. Click on the *create* button
. Make sure that *Application page* is selected
. Type the name: _claimsList_
. Click on the *Create* button
+

On the new page, the first step is to add a variable:

. At the bottom of the UI Designer, in the *Variables* tab, click on *Create a new variable*
. Configure the new variable:
 ** name: _claims_
 ** type: _External API_
 ** API URL: _../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.Claim?q=find&p=0&c=100_
. Click on the *Save* button
+

Add and configure the table widget:

. From the widget palette on the left, drag and drop a *Table* widget to the whiteboard
. In the widget property on the right:
 ** Set the *headers* name: _Description, Answer, Satisfaction level_
 ** For *content*, click on the *fx* button and enter _claims_ for the value
 ** Set *Column keys* to: _description, answer, satisfactionLevel_
. Click on the UI Designer *Save* button
. Click on the *preview* button to get a preview of your page

[WARNING]
====

In order for preview to access the data, a user needs to be logged in to the Bonita Portal. You can click on the *Portal* button in the Bonita Studio tool bar to make sure a user is logged in.

Now you have your first application page. It's time to move to the next chapter and create the application that will include the page.
