= Using Alfresco with Bonita
:description: Bonita allows you to connect Alfresco ECM content platform.

Bonita allows you to connect Alfresco ECM content platform.

== Connecting to Alfresco

Bonita Studio contains connectors for Alfresco 3.4 and Alfresco 4.2. For each version, there are the following connectors:

* Delete an item by ID (folder, file, etc)
* Delete folder by path (delete a folder and its contents)
* Create a folder by path
* Upload a file to a destination folder

Notes for using these connectors:

* WARNING: There is a conflict between libraries provided with the Alfresco connector and libraries provided by other connectors or the platform itself if you use a data of type Object. +
When you configure a process that uses the Alfresco connector, you must xref:manage-jar-files.adoc[manage the jar files].
* To delete a folder, it must be empty.
* In the path, all parameters have to be http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp[URL Encoded]. Spaces are not allowed. For example: `/User Homes/user` has to be written `/User%20Homes/user`.
